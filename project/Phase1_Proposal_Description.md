# Phase 1 — Proposal & Pre‑Production 

Propose **one playable scene (vertical slice)** with clear boundaries and a realistic plan to build it this semester.

Your submission should answer:
1) **What** are we building (start → end, player experience, core loop)?  
2) **How** will we build it (scope, risks, tasks, workflow)?  

For the full project descrioption, refer to the following link: https://github.com/gamedevkfupm/swe402/blob/main/project/project_description.md

## What to submit 
### One proposal document (Markdown)
Create: `docs/phase1/proposal.md` 


Your proposal must include:
- **Scene summary:** goal, start/end boundaries, core loop, success/failure states
- **Benchmark reference:** 1 target game scene video 
- **Scope list:** must‑have + nice‑to‑have + explicit **NOT doing**
- **Production plan:** GitHub Project board plan + roles/ownership + Phase 2 checkpoint bullets

Your proposal should show clearly how are you going to apply the following competencies:


- **Core gameplay systems engineering**: player controls, interaction model, fail/win states, and game-state flow.
- **Physics and collision systems**: deterministic interactions, hit detection, and reliable response logic.
- **AI behavior design**: enemy or boss behavior using state-driven logic (for example, finite state machines or behavior trees).
- **Real-time graphics pipeline**: materials, lighting, rendering settings, and scene readability.
- **Technical art and polish**: animation, VFX, camera design, and post-processing.
- **Audio systems design**: SFX, music integration, mixing, and spatial/3D audio where relevant.
- **UI/UX feedback**: HUD, prompts, combat/system feedback, and usability-driven flow.
- **Performance optimization and debugging**: profiling evidence, bottleneck analysis, and stability fixes.
- **Production and collaboration practices**: GitHub workflow, documentation, issue tracking, milestone planning, and iterative delivery.

## Rubrics 


| **Criteria (Points)**                                        | **Strong**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Good**                                                                                                                              | **Weak**                                                                                | **Missing**                                             |

| **Scene Definition & Scope Discipline (25)**                 | Clear start trigger and end condition; explicit player journey; core gameplay loop clearly structured; concrete win/fail states; realistic Must / Nice / NOT doing list with tight scope control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Start/end mostly clear; loop described but not fully structured; scope defined but slightly optimistic; “NOT doing” present but weak. | Vague boundaries; unclear core loop; scope too large; missing meaningful exclusions.    | Scene unclear or unbounded; no defined loop or scope.   |
| **Benchmark Deconstruction & Systems Awareness (20)**        | Video reference included; scene broken into technical systems (controls, AI, physics, UI, camera, etc.); clear replication vs simplification logic; technical reasoning visible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Reference included; systems identified but shallow analysis; simplification partially justified.                                      | Reference mentioned but minimally analyzed; mostly descriptive.                         | No meaningful benchmark analysis.                       |

Coverage is specific, realistic, and technically grounded. | Most major competency areas addressed with reasonable clarity; integration explained but lacks depth in some areas.                   | Several competency areas missing or superficially described; weak integration thinking. | Little to no evidence of technical competency coverage. |
| **Production Planning & Task Structure (20)**                | Clear milestone plan; tasks broken into actionable units; roles/ownership defined; acceptance criteria included; realistic sequencing of work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Milestones defined; roles assigned; tasks somewhat large; limited acceptance criteria.                                                | Tasks vague; weak ownership; unclear milestones.                                        | No structured production plan.                          |
